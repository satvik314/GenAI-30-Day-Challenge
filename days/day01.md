# Day 1: Introduction to Generative AI >

## =Ì Objective
Understand what Generative AI is, how it differs from traditional AI, and explore key concepts that form the foundation of modern GenAI systems.

## <¯ Today's Exercise (10-15 minutes)

### Part 1: Understanding the Basics (5 min)

**What is Generative AI?**
- Traditional AI: Classifies, predicts, or analyzes existing data
- Generative AI: Creates new content (text, images, audio, code) based on patterns learned from training data

**Key Concepts:**
1. **Large Language Models (LLMs)**: AI models trained on massive text datasets (GPT-4, Claude, Gemini)
2. **Training vs. Inference**:
   - Training: Teaching the model (expensive, time-consuming)
   - Inference: Using the trained model (what you do when using ChatGPT)
3. **Prompts**: Instructions you give to the AI to generate output

### Part 2: Hands-On Exploration (7 min)

**Task**: Try these three prompts with any AI chatbot (ChatGPT, Claude, etc.) and observe the differences:

1. **Vague Prompt**: "Write about dogs"

2. **Specific Prompt**: "Write a 50-word paragraph about Golden Retrievers as family pets, highlighting their temperament"

3. **Structured Prompt**: "Act as a veterinarian. Write a 50-word professional description of Golden Retrievers suitable for a family with young children. Focus on temperament and care requirements."

**Observe**:
- Which prompt gave you the best result?
- How did the AI's "role" affect the output?
- What happened when you added constraints (word count)?

### Part 3: Reflection (3 min)

Write down your observations:
- What surprised you about the AI's responses?
- What's the difference between your best and worst result?

## =¡ Key Takeaways

- **Generative AI creates new content** rather than just analyzing data
- **Prompts are instructions** - more specific prompts typically yield better results
- **Context and constraints matter** - giving the AI a role and clear parameters improves output
- **GenAI is probabilistic** - it generates content based on patterns, not "understanding"
